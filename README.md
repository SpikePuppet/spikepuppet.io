# README

This is the code for my own private blog. I'll have more updates on what I want to do with this soon.

The main driver is that I want to own my own words. I genuinely believe that the next decade of computing is about to bring wild, sweeping changes. As such I don't want to be beholden to one platform. 

Watch this space!
